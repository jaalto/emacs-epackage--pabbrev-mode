Description: mode for TAB key to complete items (predictive abbreviation)
 Provide a abbreviation expansion for Emacs. Its fairly similar to
 "dabbrev" expansion, which works based on the contents of the current
 buffer (or other buffers).
 .
 Predictive abbreviation expansion works based on the previously written
 text. Unlike dynamic abbreviation, the text is analysed during idle time,
 while Emacs is doing nothing else. `pabbrev-mode' tells you when this is
 happening. If this irritates you unset `pabbrev-idle-timer-verbose'. The
 advantage of this is that its very quick to look up potential
 abbreviations, which means that the can be constantly displayed, without
 interfering with the user as they type. Certainly it works for me, on an
 old laptop, typing as fast as I can (which is fast, since I learnt to type
 with four fingers).
 .
 The main entry point is through the minor mode `pabbrev-mode'. There is
 also a global minor mode, called `global-pabbrev-mode', which does the
 same in all appropriate buffers.
